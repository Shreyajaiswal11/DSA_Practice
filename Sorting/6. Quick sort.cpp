- its a divide and conquer algorithm.
- it picks an element as pivot and partition the given array around the picked pivot.
- different version of quick sort
  - first element as pivot.
  - last element as pivot.
  - pick a random element as pivot.
  
- it is considered as in-place sorting algorithm. 
  - In place sorting - a sort algorithm in which the sorted items occupy the same storage as the origional ones.
  - this is usually achieved by swapping,shuffling,replacing and shifting of elements in the same array list.
- it reduces the space complexity and removes the use of the auxilliary array that is used in merge sort.
  T.C - o(nlogn)
  S.P - o(log n)
